For ENGRD 2020 Statics and Mechanics of Solids class for HW4, we were asked to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. We were given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of fixed length, 3 pin supports of which 2 need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator.

The picture above depicts the mechanism I designed.

Here is the full question and calculations:
